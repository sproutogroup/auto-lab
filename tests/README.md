# Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite ensures the reliability, security, and performance of the dealership management system. The tests cover all critical aspects of the application from unit tests to integration tests.

## Test Structure

### 1. API Tests (`api.test.ts`)

- **Key Tests**:
  - Health check endpoints
  - Authentication flows (login, logout, user validation)
  - CRUD operations for all major entities
  - Data validation and error handling
  - Business intelligence report generation

### 2. Security Tests (`security.test.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Validates security measures and protection mechanisms
- **Coverage**: Rate limiting, input validation, authentication protection, CORS, security headers
- **Key Tests**:
  - Rate limiting effectiveness
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
  - Authentication bypass prevention
  - CORS policy validation
  - Security header verification

### 3. Database Tests (`database.test.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Tests database operations, integrity, and performance
- **Coverage**: CRUD operations, data integrity, foreign key constraints, index usage
- **Key Tests**:
  - Vehicle, customer, lead CRUD operations
  - Database index performance validation
  - Foreign key constraint enforcement
  - Data integrity checks
  - Complex query performance

### 4. Business Logic Tests (`business-logic.test.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Validates business rules and calculations
- **Coverage**: Financial calculations, workflow logic, data validation
- **Key Tests**:
  - Vehicle financial calculations (purchase totals, gross profit)
  - Dashboard analytics accuracy
  - Customer and lead management workflows
  - Business intelligence report accuracy
  - Data validation rules

### 5. Performance Tests (`performance.test.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Ensures system performance meets production requirements
- **Coverage**: Response times, concurrent load, memory usage, database performance
- **Key Tests**:
  - Response time validation (< 100ms for simple, < 500ms for complex)
  - Concurrent request handling
  - Memory leak detection
  - Database query optimization
  - Rate limiting performance impact

### 6. Integration Tests (`integration.test.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Tests complete business workflows and system integration
- **Coverage**: End-to-end workflows, user permissions, data consistency
- **Key Tests**:
  - Complete vehicle sales workflow (lead → customer → sale)
  - User permission system integration
  - Data consistency across modules
  - Business intelligence cross-report validation

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

- Node.js environment
- Database connection
- Required dependencies installed

### Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- api.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

### Test Configuration

Tests are configured in `jest.config.js` with:

- TypeScript support
- 30-second timeout for complex operations
- Coverage reporting
- Module path mapping for imports

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy

- **Isolated**: Each test creates its own test data
- **Cleanup**: All tests clean up after themselves
- **Authentic**: Uses real data structures, not mocks
- **Consistent**: Standardized test data patterns

### Test Database

- Uses the same database schema as production
- Test data is isolated by unique identifiers
- Automatic cleanup prevents test pollution
- Foreign key constraints are maintained

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets

- **Health checks**: < 100ms
- **Simple queries**: < 200ms
- **Complex queries**: < 500ms
- **Business intelligence**: < 1000ms
- **Concurrent requests**: < 2000ms for 10 simultaneous

### Memory Usage

- **Memory leaks**: < 50MB increase over 50 requests
- **Large datasets**: < 1000ms for 1000 records
- **Concurrent load**: Stable memory usage under load

## Security Test Coverage

### Authentication Tests

- Login/logout flows
- Session management
- Password validation
- Role-based access control

### Input Validation

- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Data type validation
- Required field validation

### Rate Limiting

- Global rate limits
- Authentication rate limits
- API endpoint limits
- Speed limiting effectiveness

### Security Headers

- Content Security Policy
- CORS configuration
- XSS protection headers
- Frame options validation

## Business Logic Validation

### Financial Calculations

- Purchase price totals
- Sale price calculations
- Gross profit computation
- VAT and fee handling

### Workflow Logic

- Lead progression stages
- Customer conversion
- Vehicle status changes
- Appointment scheduling

### Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints
- Required field validation
- Data type enforcement

## Integration Test Scenarios

### Complete Sales Workflow

1. Create lead with vehicle interest
2. Schedule appointment for viewing
3. Progress lead through pipeline stages
4. Convert lead to customer
5. Complete vehicle sale
6. Update appointment status
7. Verify dashboard statistics

### Permission System

1. Create user with limited permissions
2. Test authentication
3. Verify access restrictions
4. Validate permitted operations

### Data Consistency

1. Create related entities
2. Test referential integrity
3. Verify cascading operations
4. Validate cross-module consistency

## Continuous Integration

### Test Automation

- Automated test execution on code changes
- Coverage reporting
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Quality Gates

- Minimum 70% code coverage
- All security tests must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- No failing integration tests

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow existing test patterns
2. Include proper setup/teardown
3. Use authentic test data
4. Document test purpose
5. Maintain performance targets
