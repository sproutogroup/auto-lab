Feature Overview

Goal: Embed an AI-driven “smart reports” engine that can:
Understand free-form, business-domain questions (e.g. “Show me this month’s top-selling regions.”)
Fetch & analyze live data from the DMS
Generate textual insights, summaries, and structured reports
Render charts and tables on demand
Allow drill-downs and follow-ups via chat-style interface
2. High-Level Architecture

UI Layer
On the Reports page, add a chat widget / query bar
“Ask AI” button to fire a query
Report canvas area for text + charts + tables
Backend Service (“AI Orchestrator”)
Accepts user NL queries
Validates & sanitizes inputs
Maps queries to data-fetch operations (SQL or API calls)
Builds prompt templates
Calls OpenAI API
Parses responses, structures JSON (e.g. { text, charts: [...], tables: [...] })
Data Access Layer
Reuses existing DMS database models/ORM
Exposes endpoints for common aggregations (sales by date, top SKUs, margins, etc.)
Visualization Engine
Renders charts (bar, line, pie) via your chosen library (e.g. Chart.js / D3)
Maps AI JSON instructions to chart configs
3. OpenAI Integration

Model Selection: gpt-4 (or latest high-capability model) for deep analysis; fallback gpt-3.5-turbo for quick responses
Prompt Engineering:
You are an analytics assistant for a dealer management system. 
Given these data excerpts: {“revenue_by_region”: […], “sales_trends”: […]}, answer the question: “{user_query}”.
Provide:
  1. A brief summary of insights
  2. Top 3 recommendations
  3. If requested, generate markdown tables or JSON chart specs.
Security:
Never send raw PII.
Enforce length limits.
Cache repeated queries for cost control.
Error Handling:
Gracefully degrade to “we can’t answer that right now.”
Log API errors + user query + timestamp.
4. User Flows & Stories

Ad-hoc Query
User: “What were our top-performing products in Q2?”
System:
Parses “top-performing products” → calls /api/sales/top-products?start=2025-04-01&end=2025-06-30
Receives data → injects into prompt
Calls OpenAI → displays:
Text summary
Bar chart of top 5 SKUs
Scheduled Report Generation
User: “Email me a weekly summary of inventory turnover.”
System:
Stores a schedule (cron: Mon 8:00)
Runs orchestrator automatically
Renders PDF/HTML and emails.
5. UI/UX Requirements

Chat Widget:
History of Q&A
“Regenerate” & “Refine” buttons
Report Builder:
Drag-and-drop metrics
Save templates
Output Formats:
On-screen (HTML + SVG)
Export CSV / PDF / PowerPoint
6. Non-Functional & Operational

Performance:
Aim for < 2s responses on cached queries; < 5s uncached
Scalability:
Queue long jobs; use async workers
Logging & Analytics:
Track query types, latencies, error rates
Testing:
Unit tests for prompt templates
Integration tests mocking OpenAI
Security & Compliance:
Audit logs of all AI interactions
GDPR: strip personal data
