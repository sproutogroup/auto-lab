I'll help you design an intelligent notification system with SMS capabilities and AI integration for your dealership management system. Here's a comprehensive plan:

Overview
The notification system will have these core components:

Event Triggers - Monitor key business actions
SMS Service Integration - Send notifications via SMS
AI Bot Enhancement - Intelligent message generation and routing
User Preferences - Configurable notification settings
Notification History - Track and manage sent notifications
External Dependencies
SMS Service Provider
I recommend Twilio for SMS capabilities:

Reliable delivery
Global coverage
Good API documentation
Reasonable pricing
AI Service
Use OpenAI GPT for intelligent message generation:

Generate contextual messages
Summarize complex data
Personalize notifications
Internal Implementation Plan
1. Database Schema
shared/notification-schema.ts
Add notification system database schemas
2. SMS Service Integration
server/services/sms-service.ts
Create SMS service with Twilio integration
3. AI Message Generation Service
server/services/ai-service.ts
Create AI service for intelligent message generation
4. Notification Engine
server/services/notification-service.ts
Create main notification service engine
5. API Routes for Notification Management
server/routes/notifications.ts
Add notification management API routes
6. Integration Points in Existing Code
You'll need to integrate notification triggers in your existing business logic. Here are key integration points:

In Job Updates:

// In your job update API
import { notificationService } from './services/notification-service';
// When job is completed
if (updatedJob.status === 'completed') {
  await notificationService.jobCompleted(updatedJob.id, updatedJob.assigned_user_id);
}
In Vehicle Sales:

// When vehicle is sold
await notificationService.vehicleSold(vehicleId, salespersonId, customerName);
Environment Variables
Add these to your .env:

# Twilio SMS Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# Notification Settings
NOTIFICATION_FROM_NAME="Dealership System"
Setup Steps
Install dependencies:

npm install twilio openai
Create database tables using the schemas above

Configure external services:

Sign up for Twilio SMS
Get OpenAI API key
Set environment variables
Integrate notification triggers in your existing business logic

Add frontend UI for users to manage their notification preferences

This system provides intelligent, contextual notifications that can scale with your business needs. The AI enhancement makes messages more natural and informative, while the flexible event system allows you to easily add new notification types as your business grows.
