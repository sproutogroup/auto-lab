1. JSON‚Äêbody parsing failures

Missing or mis‚Äêordered express.json()
What happens: If you never do
app.use(express.json());
(or if you do it after you register your routes) Express won‚Äôt parse incoming JSON. A malformed or unexpectedly un‚Äêparsed JSON payload will throw a SyntaxError inside the JSON parser, and the default Express error handler will turn that into a bare ‚Äú400 Bad Request‚Äù with an empty body.
How to fix:
In your main server file, before any app.post() or app.use(requireAuth) calls, add:
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
Restart the server and re‚Äërun your curl, making sure to include:
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
Add a one‚Äëoff log immediately under the parser to confirm it‚Äôs firing:
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Body parser saw:", req.headers["content-type"], req.body);
  next();
});
2. Route not actually being hit

Wrong mount path
What happens: If you do something like
const router = express.Router();
router.post("/debug/send-test-push", ‚Ä¶);
app.use("/api", router);
then the actual path is /api/debug/send-test-push, not /debug/send-test-push. Hitting the wrong URL often yields 404‚Äîbut if you have any other middleware (e.g. a body‚Äêparser or validation) set to reject unknown routes, you can get a silent 400 instead.
How to fix:
Grep your code for where router.post(...) lives and see if it‚Äôs nested under a app.use("/api", ...).
Add a minimal ‚Äúhello‚Äêworld‚Äù route at the very top of your file to confirm reachability:
app.post("/ping", (req, res) => res.json({ pong: true }));
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ping to make sure the server is up and listening where you think it is.
3. Authentication/Authorization middleware swallowing errors

What happens: A faulty requireAuth could be short‚Äëcircuiting the request (e.g. checking for a CSRF token in the body or headers and returning 400 if it‚Äôs missing) before your handler ever runs.
How to fix:
Temporarily remove or bypass requireAuth on your debug route.
Add a quick unconditional handler:
app.post("/debug/send-test-push", (req, res) => {
  return res.json({ reached: true });
});
If that works, you know the guard middleware is the culprit. Inspect it for any if (!req.body._csrf)-style checks or other early res.status(400).end() calls.
4. Testing WebPushService in isolation

Even once we get the endpoint accepting your JSON, it‚Äôs wise to unit‚Äëtest the actual push logic separately:

// scripts/testWebPush.js
import WebPushService from "../server/services/webPushService";
import storage from "../server/storage";

async function smokeTest() {
  const sub = await storage.getPushSubscriptionById(1);
  await WebPushService.sendWebPush(sub, {
    title: "üöÄ Smoke test",
    body: "Payload works!"
  });
  console.log("Test push sent.");
}

smokeTest().catch(err => {
  console.error("Smoke test failed:", err);
  process.exit(1);
});
Run it with:

node --loader ts-node/esm scripts/testWebPush.js
If you see detailed errors here, you know the problem is in your push code and not the HTTP layer.

Next Steps
Verify JSON parsing by adding app.use(express.json()) at the top and sending the proper Content-Type.
Confirm route bindings with a bare‚Äêbones /ping endpoint.
Isolate requireAuth to see whether it‚Äôs rejecting the route.
Unit‚Äêtest your WebPushService directly to ensure your VAPID config and web-push.sendNotification() are all wired up.
Once your endpoint reliably reaches your handler and logs the incoming body, and your unit test confirms the push code works, we‚Äôll have knocked out the root cause and can finish Phase¬†2‚Äôs retry and cleanup logic. Let me know what you discover!
